## About Me
======
I’m a PhD candidate at UC Berkeley working within the Delphi Group, where I integrate epidemiology research with advanced machine learning techniques. My academic path has been enriched by hands-on experiences and collaborations across multiple sectors, including internships at Apple and Genentech. Under the guidance of my co-advisors, [Ryan Tibshirani](#) and [Giles Hooker](#), I have developed a research portfolio that emphasizes the responsible and transparent use of machine learning, especially in high-stakes environments.

My work bridges the gap between rigorous academic research and practical industry applications. I value an interdisciplinary approach that combines robust statistical methods with modern machine learning practices to address real-world challenges. Whether it’s through developing innovative algorithms or collaborating with public health organizations, my goal is to ensure that data-driven decisions are both reliable and interpretable.

## Research Interests
======
My research is centered on several key themes that are critical to the safe and effective deployment of machine learning:

### Uncertainty Quantification & Black-Box Models
In many applications, particularly those involving black-box models, it’s essential to understand the confidence behind predictions. I focus on uncertainty quantification techniques to provide clear measures of predictive reliability. This includes my work on forecast ensembling, where I explore methods to aggregate predictions in a way that highlights their inherent uncertainties, ensuring that decision-makers can trust the outcomes.

### Model Interpretability & Stability
Interpretability is a cornerstone of responsible machine learning. I am dedicated to enhancing popular interpretability tools such as SHAP, LIME, and counterfactual explanations. My research addresses the variability inherent in these methods by quantifying and reducing their instability. By doing so, I aim to improve the transparency of models, making them more dependable for critical applications in health and finance.

### Epidemiology & Public Health Applications
Working within the Delphi Group has allowed me to apply my expertise to epidemiological challenges. A significant part of my research involves developing trend filtering methods that detect real-time shifts in vital public health metrics, such as the case-fatality rate during epidemics like COVID-19. These methods are designed to provide actionable insights that can guide timely interventions, and I regularly share our findings with public health organizations, including the CDC and local health departments.

### Bridging Academia and Industry
My experiences in both academic and industrial settings have shaped a unique perspective on the practical deployment of machine learning. Through internships and collaborative projects, I’ve explored the application of advanced statistical techniques in diverse fields such as biotechnology, finance, and technology. I am particularly interested in quantitative finance and advanced interpretability methods, continually seeking ways to integrate uncertainty quantification and Bayesian approaches into real-world applications.

### Future Directions
Looking forward, I am excited about expanding my research to include cutting-edge techniques like Sparse Auto-Encoders for Large Language Models (LLMs) and exploring further Bayesian extensions. These future projects are aimed at developing robust software packages and methodologies that reliably inform decisions in high-impact domains. My ongoing work is driven by the commitment to making machine learning not only powerful but also transparent and trustworthy.
