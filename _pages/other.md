## Other

Throughout grad school, I've performed in the flute section of the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra. Some highlights include [Alpine Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhlrcdNwnCI&t=2329s&ab_channel=UCBerkeleyMusic), [Rachmaninoff 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvEGVEJtI8U&list=PL2sVgxXY8koMfe_fcxomtJNX57Q5XR_ck&index=9&ab_channel=UCBerkeleyMusic), and [Mahler 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50JV_3pdjvY&t=7242s&ab_channel=UCBerkeleyMusic) - the last of which I was lucky enough to perform in Vienna's Musikverein. In addition to classical music, I love reading and exploring national parks.

I did a Q&A with GatherBay, a lovely Jewish organization based in the East Bay. It's linked [here](https://gatherbay.org/jeremy-goldwasser/). 

A bigger name in ML at Berkeley is Shafi Goldwasser, the former head of the Simons Institute. No relation, as far as I'm aware.
