### Preference Learning & LLMs

I wrote a [blog-esque document](/files/Tibbles_Group_Preference_Learning.pdf) on training LLMs for a lab presentation. Per its audience, it devotes a lot of energy towards motivating RLHF and DPO from a statistical perspective, via Bradley-Terry. 

### ML Interpretability

Prof. Giles Hooker and I co-wrote two papers quantifying and reducing uncertainty in SHAP and other feature importance scores. [These slides](/files/interpretability.pdf) overview both papers. I have presented this work at the following venues:
- Center for Human-Compatible AI
- World Conference on Explainable Artificial Intelligence
- Apple, Data Analytics and Quality group within Hardware Technologies

### Epidemic Severity Rates

Many important epidemiological metrics, such as the case-fatality rate, relate two time series to one another. These "severity rates" are typicaly estimated with a ratio of aggregate counts, for example deaths today divided by cases *L* days ago. While seemingly reasonable, we show these ratio estimators have stark failure modes. We derive bias expressions and propose robust ML-based alternatives. 

I have presented slides on [Bias](/files/Severity Bias Talk.pdf) and [Estimation](/files/Severity Estimation Talk.pdf) of severity rates to a wide range of audiences.
