### Preference Learning & LLMs

I wrote a [blog-esque document](/files/Tibbles_Group_Preference_Learning.pdf) on training LLMs for a lab presentation. Per its audience, it devotes a lot of energy towards motivating RLHF and DPO from a statistical perspective, via Bradley-Terry. 

### Epidemic Severity Rates

Many important epidemiological metrics, such as the case-fatality rate, fall under the categorization of "severity rates." These are typicaly estimated with a ratio of aggregate counts, for example deaths today divided by cases *L* days ago. While seemingly reasonable, these ratio estimators have stark failure modes. We derive bias expressions and propose ML-based alternatives that circumvent these challenges. 

I have presented this work to a wide range of audiences.
- Public health: The CDC, California Department of Public Health, Santa Clara DPH
- Academic: Delphi Group, UCSF MINDSCAPE, Tibshirani & Hooker labs

### ML Interpretability

Prof. Giles Hooker and I co-wrote two papers quantifying and reducing uncertainty in SHAP and other feature importance scores. [Presentation Slides](interpretability.pptx) overviewing both papers may be downloaded here. I have shared this work with several audiences, including:
- Center for Human-Compatible AI
- Apple, Data Analytics and Quality team
- World Conference on Explainable Artificial Intelligence
